# Data Analysis of Spotify music networks 

The project is divided into various phases of data analysis. The first part focuses on data acquisition, detailing where to obtain the data, how to do it, and potential challenges. Subsequently, the project addresses the storage of acquired data to avoid the need for repeated acquisition. The next phase involves preprocessing the stored data. Following this, an analysis of the obtained data is conducted to characterize and extract information. Finally, graphical visualizations are generated to express the results of the analysis.

In the project, the Spotify API is utilized for the acquisition and storage of music-related data. Spotify's API provides access to music data and control over user music playback. The emphasis is on leveraging this API to practice the skills learned in the course, making use of the extensive volume of music data offered by Spotify, including songs, albums, artists, genres, etc.
